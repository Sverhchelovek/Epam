HTML (the abbreviation of Hyper Text Markup Language) and CSS can be the most basic parts of front end web development. HTML constitutes the “skeleton” of the web page, while CSS adds color style to the web page and thus forms the web appearance together. The text, images and color styles that we usually see on the web are implemented through HTML+CSS. It’s a must to master HTML and CSS in the beginning.

Front End Development Skills - HTML
Simply put, HTML is mainly used for the layout and you need to be adept on div, form table, ul, li, span, font, etc. Meanwhile, CSS is mainly used to complete HTML layout and display, what it is we call “CSS style”.

In this regard, you need to be familiar with float, position, height, width, overflow, margin, padding and other related tags. These two languages are relatively easy to learn and closely related to the layout style.

						<mark class="header-text">JavaScript and jQuery </mark> <br>

JavaScript is another basic skill to master for a front end developer. It’s been widely used in the client-side script language to add dynamic functions to HTML pages, delivering users smooth and awesome browsing experience, such as advertising switching effects, floating advertising effects, blinds effects, seamless scrolling effects, etc.

According to the Stack Overflow Survey, JavaScript is the most popular and leading language among developers and dominates the market with 62.5% shares in the programming language segment.

Front End Development Skills - JavaScript

Basically, jQuery is a lightweight JS library that is compatible with CSS3 and various web browsers, such as Safari 2.0+,<wbr>  IE 6.0+ and Opera 9.0+, etc. It helps to handle HTML, EVENTS and animation effects in a more convenient way. AJAX interaction is equivalent to a collection of JS plugins and extensions that make JS much faster and easier to be implemented.

						<mark class="header-text">ES6 & Devtools</mark> <br>
The emergence of ES6 (i.e. ECMAScript 2015) has undoubtedly brought new surprises to front end developers. It’s a JavaScript scripting language created by Netscape, evolving from ES1 to ES6 that have been added some great new features since its release. With popularity of Node.js and Angular.js, we believe that ES6 will soon become a major trend in front end framework development.

• Chrome DevTools
This refers to the Chrome Developer Tools, which are built into Google Chrome for iterating, debugging and analyzing websites. It consists of the following sections:

• Device toolbar that helps to build a fully adaptive website that’s mobile-first.

• Elements that’s used to freely manage DOM and CSS to iterate over layout and design pages.

• Console panel that collects logs diagnostic information or interacts with JavaScript as a shell on the page.

• Sources that set breakpoints to debug JavaScript, or connect to local files via WorkSpaces, using the real-time editor of the developer tools.

In addition, it also includes Network, Performance, Memory, Application, Security, Customize and Control DevTools,<wbr> and more. Here’s the Google developer tools documentation.

				<h2>My Main Purpose</h2>
				<article>
				The Übermensch (German for "Beyond-Man", "Superman", "Overman", "Superhuman", "Hyperman", "Hyperhuman") is a concept in the philosophy of Friedrich Nietzsche. In his 1883 book Thus Spoke Zarathustra  Nietzsche has his character Zarathustra posit the Übermensch as a goal for humanity to set for itself. It is a work of philosophical allegory, with a structural similarity to the Gathas of Zoroaster/Zarathustra.
				In 1896, Alexander Tille made the first English translation of Thus Spoke Zarathustra, rendering Übermensch as "Beyond-Man". In 1909, Thomas Common translated it as "Superman", following the terminology of George Bernard Shaw's 1903 stage play Man and Superman. Walter Kaufmann lambasted this translation in the 1950s for two reasons: first, the failure of the English prefix "super" to capture the nuance of the German über (though in Latin, its meaning of "above" or "beyond" is closer to the German); and second, for promoting misidentification of Nietzsche's concept with the comic-book character Superman (whom Fredric Wertham described as "un-American and fascist"). Kaufmann and others preferred to translate Übermensch as "overman". Scholars continue to employ both terms, some simply opting to reproduce the German word.

				The German prefix über can have connotations of superiority, transcendence, excessiveness, or intensity, depending on the words to which it is attached. Mensch refers to a human being, rather than a male specifically. The adjective übermenschlich means super-human: beyond human strength or out of proportion to humanity.

				Nietzsche introduces the concept of the Übermensch in contrast to his understanding of the other-worldliness of Christianity: Zarathustra proclaims the will of the Übermensch to give meaning to life on earth, and admonishes his audience to ignore those who promise other-worldly fulfillment to draw them away from the earth.The turn away from the earth is prompted, he says, by a dissatisfaction with life that causes the sufferer to imagine another world which will fulfill his revenge. The Übermensch grasps the earthly world with relish and gratitude.

				Zarathustra declares that the Christian escape from this world also required the invention of an immortal soul separate from the earthly body. This led to the abnegation and mortification of the body, or asceticism. Zarathustra further links the Übermensch to the body and to interpreting the soul as simply an aspect of the body
